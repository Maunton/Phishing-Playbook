## Playbook: Phishing

The playbook for handling phishing incidents emphasizes a multi-pronged approach of investigation, remediation, and communication, all executed concurrently where possible. Rather than a strictly linear process, it encourages assigning tasks to different individuals or teams to tackle various aspects simultaneously, using their discretion.
### Investigation


* Start by scoping the attack, noting the potential phishing indicators reported by users, customers, or partners.
* Assess the scale of the attack and gather information on user interactions with the phishing email.
* Investigate related activities across social media, suspicious emails, and notifications of unusual behavior.
* Analyze the phishing message and associated links or attachments using safe devices and specialized tools.
* Categorize the type and severity of the attack, considering factors like data risk and potential impact on services.

### Remediation

*	Plan remediation actions to be launched in tandem, considering the timing and impact of each step.
*	Implement containment measures such as changing credentials, limiting access to critical systems, and blocking malicious activities.
*	Preserve forensic evidence and contain broader compromises according to established procedures.
*	Enhance monitoring and consider external assistance for thorough investigation and response.

### Communication

*	Escalate the incident as per protocol and document it accordingly.
*	Communicate internally with relevant teams and leadership, keeping them informed of incident response updates and impact.
*	Notify affected users and customers, providing guidance on necessary actions and precautions.
*	Comply with legal obligations, including reporting to authorities and involving external security and IT vendors.
*	Facilitate recovery by initiating business continuity plans and reinforcing training programs against phishing attacks.
